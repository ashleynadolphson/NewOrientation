      <p>New Orientation was established in 1984, inspired by our founder, Neena's love for the beauty and rich history behind Blue and White porcelain from the Orient. The affair continues today as Utah's loveliest wedding registry and hub of darling gifts, jewelry, and everything that makes home, well, home.</p>
      
      <p>Under Neena's loving, stylish, and dare we say magical hands, the store has flourished for over 30 years. But our dedication and admiration remain as it was in the very beginning. From the first days, we've been obsessed with sleek designs that delight in detail and are enchanted by the stationery that pops out of our mailboxes, glamorous jewels, the perfect teacup, and everything that falls in between.</p>
